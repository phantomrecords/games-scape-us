        &quot;pong&quot; with a rotating globe of the planet
        earth. The game is three dimensional with the bouncing
        globe rebounding from the 'front' and 'back' of the
        monitor as well as the sides and top. It's the best
        install for its time I've seen since Pulse's first
        release, Iron Helix (wherein you get to </p>

        a T-Rex bite, throw in the air, and devour a business man

        when you shell out fifty bucks for a game you want
        gratification the second after the CD goes in the drive.<p><img

        is not for the faint hearted. If you don't like puzzle
        games, there's not much action in Bad Mojo. There aren't
        people to talk to and there isn't treasure to get. The
        world isn't a beautiful place and it doesn't seem likely
        to get better. It may not be the game for everyone. </p>

        three restores but until then, I couldn't move my roach
        back or forward). Michael Sommers does some pretty
        hideous overacting in the opening sequence (that's
        nothing new to computer games) but still pulls it off.<p><img
