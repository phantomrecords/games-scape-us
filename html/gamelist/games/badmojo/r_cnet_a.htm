        over that first queasy gagging reflex, you're off on a
        remarkable and quite unique adventure. The game's artwork
        is superbly realistic, right down to your roach's
        shifting shadow. And there are plenty of good, solid
        puzzles, as well as an air of mystery that will totally
        captivate you. <p><img src="../../images/spacer.gif"
