        look for any Mortal Kombat-style combo attacks or
        finishing moves. You're a roach. About all you can do is
        use your head... in more ways than one. In addition to
        thinking creatively, you'll also have to push things
        around with your little noggin. Useless bottle caps
        become bridges if pushed in the right direction. And just

        unfold as you receive clues from an oracle who helps you
        along the way. There are also a few kindred insect
