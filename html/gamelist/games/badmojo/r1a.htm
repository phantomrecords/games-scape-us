        discovery, rather than action. There are puzzles, of
        course, but most of them aren't lethal. Some puzzles test
        your survival skills like navigating around a roach motel
        or killing a spider. Other puzzles are barrier problems,
        how do you get from the paper towel dispenser to the
        floor, when wet paint covers the walls? The rest just
        advance the plot and move you through your quest of
        finding a way to change yourself back into a human being.

        hands, you can't manipulate objects in the usual way, but
        as a cockroach equipped with human intelligence, you
        aren't exactly helpless. It's amazing how many puzzles
        can be solved by pushing objects with your head. <p><img

        there's more to this game than great graphics and
        puzzles. It's also a story about discovery and
        enlightenment. As our hero scurries from room to room, he
        quite practically gets a new perspective of himself, of

        height="15">All in all, Bad Mojo is just the thing for
        gamers who truly hunger for something unique and totally
        off the beaten track. If anyone does crave a comparison,
        oddly enough, I'd say that Bad Mojo resembles Myst.
        Despite the difference in sensibilities, both games
        involve puzzles and exploration against stunning visual
        backdrops.</p>
