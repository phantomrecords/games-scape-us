Walkthrough and Secrets - by Mark Smith<br>
PlayStation Version - Some details may vary on PC-CDROM<br>
Version 1.0 - 12/05/96 <br>
<br>
Caves - Items: 7 - Secrets: 3 - Kills 14<br>
<br>
Follow the tracks running past the slots with the poison darts. <br>
If you keep running the darts will miss you. Continue around the <br>
corner. Lara will look up at a ledge indicating the way to go but<br>
first we need to get a secret. Continue straight into a large
square<br>
room with a door in the corner. You must use the slanted rock to <br>
jump onto this door. You can either jump back then forward off
the<br>
sloped face or you can climb up the back of the sloped rock and
jump<br>
as you slide down. Either way you will grip the base of the door
to<br>
enter SECRET #1 and get the medkit.<br>
<br>
Returning to the other cave, climb up and head down the passage.
The<br>
sounds of bats should alert you to draw your gun and kill them.
Turn<br>
left and proceed to a dead end cave with snow drifted into one
corner.<br>
Climb the drift as far as you can then use the action key to grab
the<br>
ledge and pull yourself up. Waste the bat and grab the Medkit for<br>
SECRET #2. Return to the bat cave and continue. You will
eventually <br>
end up in a large grass covered cavern sloped down. Make you way
to<br>
bottom and drop into the tunnel. Go to the door and use the
switch to<br>
open the door. Kill the bat as you enter this large room. Ignore
the<br>
bamboo door - you can't open it anyway.<br>
<br>
Find the hole in the roof and climb up. Make your way to the
large<br>
room with 2 bridges and 2 wolves patrolling the ground. You can <br>
sniper these guys from the ledge. You can either wind your way
around<br>
using the bridges your take the shortcut by dropping to the
ground and<br>
proceeding to the second bridge. Standing in the middle jump and
pull<br>
yourself up onto the bridge and go to your right. Continue
through<br>
the door and into the next room.<br>
<br>
There is a large gap in this room with a bear at the bottom. A
save<br>
game gem is on the other side. You can make this jump and save
your<br>
game either before or after killing the bear from above. Drop
down<br>
into the gap by gripping the edge and dropping in to avoid taking
<br>
damage. Go through the door killing the 2 bats. Grab the medkit
and<br>
then stand on the pressure plate to open door. You will now enter
<br>
the bridge room. Climb back up the bridge and retrace your path
back <br>
to the gap and the location of the save gem. If you didn't use it
<br>
before then use it now. Proceed down the stairs. There is a
medkit<br>
to the left of the stairs if you are collecting this things.<br>
<br>
As you enter the room the music starts and the wolves attack.
Kill <br>
both of them quickly. Notice on the far wall there is a door
cleverly<br>
hidden in the vegetation. A ledge extends from the door which you
can<br>
jump onto from either side. Enter this door for SECRET #3 - a
large <br>
medkit.<br>
<br>
The other door out of this room is on a timed switch. Go to the
far<br>
corner and throw the switch. Then either make 2 skilled jumps to
the<br>
ledge with the door or just drop down - run across - and climb up
and<br>
run through the door. Continue up and turn the corner. Run past
the<br>
2 dart shooting pipes and into the next room. A single wolf is<br>
waiting for you so watch out. There are 2 broken floor tiles in
this <br>
room. Stand on either one to fall (safely) into the room below.<br>
<br>
Do not drop into the hall below - it is lined with dart traps.
Find<br>
the ledge where you can safely jump across to the other side.
Shoot<br>
the last wolf on this level and pick up the medkit. Continue on
and<br>
around the corner to find a switch. Move it to open the EXIT. To<br>
avoid the darts just slide down the sloped wall next to the EXIT.<br>
<br>
<br>
City of Vilcabama - Items: 11 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 29<br>
<br>
Run into the first room and kill the 4 wolves lurking in here.
Jump<br>
around to avoid their attacks and keep firing. There are multiple
<br>
exits from this room. Take whichever one you want as they all end<br>
up at the same place eventually. Kill all the wolves and bats you<br>
encounter. Some bats are lurking in the ceiling so look UP often.<br>
One wolf guards a medkit hidden in the bushes. Eventually you
will<br>
end up in a large room with a pool in the middle.<br>
<br>
There is a wooden trough along one wall. If you go near this wall
a<br>
large bear comes charging out. Dodge his attacks and kill him
quickly<br>
then enter the room he came out of. Vault onto the ledge above
the<br>
stable and get the medkit. Now return to the pool room and go for
a<br>
swim.<br>
<br>
Dive in and go to the T intersection and turn right. Make a
U-turn <br>
to the left when you reach the pillars and throw the wood lever
to<br>
open a secret door in another area. If you still have enough air<br>
(about half) then swim to the opposite side of the pillar room
into<br>
the brightly lit area. Throw the other wooden switch to open a
hatch<br>
above you. Surface and breath. Exit the water and get SECRET #1 -
a<br>
medkit.<br>
<br>
Throw the switch to open door and return to the main room. Dive
into<br>
the pool again and this time swim to the T and turn left. Follow
the<br>
passage to a left turn and follow until you surface into a room
with<br>
serpent fountains. Exit the pool and go through the secret door
you<br>
opened early (remember that lever) and get SECRET #2 - a medkit
and<br>
magnum clips. Return to the main pool room and surface.<br>
<br>
Find the door with the switch (looks like zebra stripes) and open
the<br>
door. Climb the wooden stairs and make the tricky jump at the
top.<br>
You will be looking across at an alcove made of skulls. Below you
is<br>
a ledge of collapsible panels. Drop down and run and jump over to
<br>
this alcove. This is tricky and if you don't do it the first time
you<br>
don't get another chance. It's only a medkit so don't worry if
you <br>
don't make it. Drop into the room below (if you didn't land there
by<br>
accident) and find the blue stone with the two indentations.<br>
<br>
Using the action key and the UP arrow Lara can push this block
into<br>
the wall. It takes several pushes to move it all the way. If you<br>
missed the large jump and really want that medkit in the skull
alcove<br>
you can use the action key and down arrow to pull the block into
the<br>
room and use it to climb into the alcove.<br>
<br>
Once you are in the next room kill the bat and get the Silver Key
and<br>
the Gold Idol. Using the block you pushed in, climb up and onto
the<br>
wooden ledge. Kill the 2 bats in the rafters and save your game.<br>
Run around the corner and kill 2 more bats. Drop into the passage
and<br>
turn left. You should now be back in the main pool room. Turn
left<br>
again to find the locked door. The action key will unlock the
door.<br>
<br>
Darts line the walls of this room and you will take at least one
hit<br>
UNLESS you do a dive. Just run and jump and hit action while in
mid-<br>
air and you will hit the ground rolling - no damage!<br>
<br>
You are now in a large area with a temple at the far end and 5
wolves<br>
with bad attitudes scattered about. Kill them as they charge
doing<br>
all that fancy jumping to avoid their fangs. Enter the temple
through<br>
the left door. Follow the passage into a pool room with ledges on
the<br>
walls. Climb the stairs and being the jumping process to go from <br>
ledge to ledge. Climb the stairs and kill the bat then make a
long<br>
jump across the top of this tower. Climb some more stairs and
kill<br>
another bat. Find and use the wall switch to open the temple's
right<br>
door. Get the medkit then go to the window. <br>
<br>
Looking down at the ledge find the shotgun shells. Execute the <br>
safety drop onto the roof and get the shells then drop to the red
roof<br>
and get the medkit. Drop once more to the ground and enter the
right<br>
door. This is another room with water and ledges and collapsing<br>
floor tiles. Go to the left and stair-step up the ledges along
this<br>
wall. At the top kill the bat, climb the stairs and use the
switch to<br>
open the middle door of the temple. Go outside and use the save
game<br>
gem then execute a series of safety drops to the ground. Enter
the<br>
middle door.<br>
<br>
A long tunnel with a series of swinging blades is your next
challenge.<br>
Just use simple timing to get past these guys. You will reach a
gate<br>
with a bear behind it. Use the switch. The floor drops out from <br>
under you and you go for another swim. Swim forward and up and
into<br>
the small tunnel on the right. The tunnel leads to stairs which
leads<br>
to a switch that opens the gate you were at moments ago and the
exit<br>
gate. Go to one of the windows and dive into the pool below (or
do a<br>
safety drop). You have to kill the bear and you can't shoot from
the<br>
water. The bear will follow you and attack as you try to exit the
<br>
pool. I found it easier to drop to the ground and blast him. You
can<br>
also run around the pool keeping the bear at a safe distance.<br>
<br>
Once the bear is dead go to the locked door. To the left of this
door<br>
is an open door. Enter the door and go up the stairs to the
switch <br>
room. There is a passage opposite the switch which leads to a
room <br>
with Uzi clips. Return to the pool room with the dead bear and
use<br>
the Gold Idol to unlock the EXIT.<br>
<br>
Lost Valley - Items: 16 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 12<br>
<br>
Follow the tunnel till you reach the river. You can either jump
in or<br>
go to your right and do some cliff diving. Find a safe place to
exit<br>
the lake and kill the 2 wolves on patrol. Climb over the rocks
opposite<br>
the waterfall and enter the cave. Kill the wolf that attacks then<br>
continue further and turn right. Jump into the slanted chamber
and kill<br>
the 3 wolves waiting here. Don't go any further as it is just a
dead<br>
end. Return to the room you were just in and find the ledge you
can<br>
pull yourself up onto. Continue climbing until you find the
skeleton<br>
and a medkit. Continue forward and slide down into the valley.<br>
<br>
A red Raptor rushes you. Fire as fast as you can and dodge this
guy's<br>
attacks. When he is dead enter the valley and kill the second
raptor.<br>
Check your health at this point and make sure its FULL. Note the<br>
broken rope bridge above. Note the HUGE FOOTPRINTS below. Note
the<br>
tense music that just started playing. Note the size of the teeth
on<br>
the T-Rex that just rounded the corner. Do a LOT of side-jumping
and<br>
keep firing until this monster is dead. You may have to heal
yourself<br>
in mid-combat. NEVER let this guy get close to you with his mouth
or<br>
you are dead no matter what your health bar says.<br>
<br>
After he is dead run past him under the bridge until you reach 2 <br>
waterfalls. Climb the ledge to the right of the right waterfall
to<br>
find SECRET #1: Shotgun shells. Go to the ledge between the
falls.<br>
Climb up 2 ledges and jump to the right onto the 3rd ledge. Hold
onto<br>
the ledge and shimmy to the right until you're in the middle of
the<br>
falls. Pull yourself up and into SECRET #2: Shells and Uzi Clips.
<br>
<br>
Return to the ground (climb or dive) and head for the broken
bridge and<br>
look for a door in the grass covered rock. Enter the passage and
kill<br>
the raptor waiting down the hall. Advance until you reach a
waterfall.<br>
Climb the ledges to the right and get Cog #1. Then dive into the
pool.<br>
Swim until you surface at the right waterfall in the valley. Turn
left<br>
and advance to the temple in the distance. Take out the 2 raptors<br>
lurking near the temple. Enter the temple and save your game.
Take a<br>
swim heading for the right side of this pool to get Cog #2. Exit
the <br>
temple and find a climbable ledge along the left valley wall near
the <br>
dead raptors. <br>
<br>
Climb the first ledge then jump left to the 2nd ledge. Turn left
to<br>
jump (or grab) the 3rd ledge then do a leap and grab the 4th
ledge.<br>
Do one more giant leap onto the temple roof for SECRET #3 and get
the<br>
medkit, magnum clips, uzi clips, and shotgun shells. You can get
back <br>
down by going left and jumping to the slanted cliff and sliding
to the<br>
bottom. Turn to the right and climb into the cave in the valley
wall.<br>
<br>
Follow the tunnel and save your game. Continue until you reach
the <br>
rope bridge. Do the giant leap and grab the other side of the
bridge.<br>
Pull yourself up and continue over to get Cog #3. Do a safety
drop to<br>
the valley floor and make your way back to the cave above the
first<br>
huge waterfall (the beginning of this level).<br>
<br>
Next is a series of jump crisscrossing the river. Miss one and
you are<br>
going for a ride over the falls so BE CAREFUL! The final jump
requires<br>
you to grab the edge and pull yourself up. Follow the tunnel and
cross<br>
the bridge. Save your game before crossing then use the 3 Cogs on
the<br>
wall then pull the lever. The dam shuts and the waterfall stops.<br>
<br>
Do NOT cross the bridge but rather drop off the side and grab on.
<br>
Shimmy left and drop onto a rock. Go up and turn left to SECRET
#4 and<br>
get a medkit. Jump in the water and swim until you reach the dam.
Turn<br>
left and pull yourself up onto the ledge. Find the skeleton and
get <br>
their shotgun (they don't need it anymore). Jump back in the
water and<br>
enter a tunnel. This is a very long tunnel but you will
eventually<br>
surface into SECRET #5 with shotgun shells and a medkit. <br>
<br>
Go through the door and jump onto the dry riverbed. Follow it to
the <br>
waterfall (or rather where the waterfall used to be) and dive
into the <br>
lake below. There is now a tunnel you can get to which used to be
<br>
blocked by the waterfall. Enter the tunnel and open the door and
EXIT!<br>
<br>
<br>
Tomb of Qualopec - Items: 7 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 7<br>
<br>
Follow the tunnel and enter the Tomb of Qualopec. Go up the slope
and<br>
a huge boulder comes rumbling towards you. Do the REVERSE move
and get<br>
outta there making sure to get out of the path as the boulder
rolls<br>
across the tomb and into the entrance.<br>
<br>
Pull the switch to open the door to the left. This frees 2
raptors who<br>
you can dispatch with your pistol. Go into the room they came out
of <br>
and save your game. Go through the door on your right and into
the <br>
next room. There are big brown blocks in here you get to push
around.<br>
Push the first block forward twice Turn left and push another
block to<br>
continue. Run across some collapsible tiles to a switch that
opens the<br>
first of 3 gates. Jump the pit you just ran across and go back to
the<br>
save game room. Go to the right door with the circle over it and
follow<br>
the passage to a small alcove with a switch. Approach the switch
and<br>
fall through the floor. Go up one of the ramps and pull the block
into<br>
the room then push it aside to find a passage. Enter and go up
stome<br>
steps and drop into a pit and get the medkit.<br>
<br>
Climb up the opposite side of the pit then go up the stairs and
pull the<br>
switch to open Gate #2. Grab the medkit in the corner then drop
back <br>
into the pit. Go back to the save game room and enter the door
with the<br>
bird. Find and use the switch to move a block with the same bird
symbol<br>
on it. Drop down into the room with the bird symbol block and go
to the<br>
left door. Go up some stairs and turn to face the white ledge.
Jump <br>
and grab several times until you reach a tunnel which takes you
to the<br>
block with the bird. Drop down a couple times then turn left and
drop <br>
down again until you are across from the bird. Jump the gap and
land on<br>
the bird block. Perform a tricky jump into the tunnel to the left
of<br>
where you just landed. Enter the tunnel and pull the switch to
move <br>
another bird block.<br>
<br>
Return to the tunnel entrance and walk to the edge facing to the
right<br>
and make a leap of faith to a block you can't see from here. Turn
and<br>
do a jump onto the second bird block then turn right and jump
into the <br>
door. Pull the switch in this room to open the final gate. Exit
this<br>
passage and jump to avoid the spike below. Go up the small ramp
and <br>
climb up to the door. Move down the right passage and waste the
raptor<br>
before he gets you. Go back to the save game room and back into
the <br>
first room of this level. Enter the new passage. Save your game
and<br>
then run past the dart guns. Doing the swandive with the roll is
a good<br>
way to not get hit here. When you reach the stairs turn to your
left.<br>
<br>
SECRET #1 waits for you if you climb up just to the right of the
dart<br>
gun. Squeeze next to the idol then run across a whole room of
those<br>
broken floor tiles. Head for the left corner and get the shotgun
shells<br>
then go for SECRET #2. Drop off the ledge and shimmy to the
outside <br>
wall and drop on the spiked floor. WALK - DO NOT RUN - through
the <br>
spikes and pick up the magnum clips under the ledge you were just
on.<br>
Walk through all the spikes to the door above and climb up and
out. <br>
<br>
Drop down to some steps and go up to the chamber with the first
piece of<br>
the Scion. Don't take the piece until you have killed the guard
on the<br>
left side of the king's throne. In true Indiana Jones fashion
taking <br>
this piece starts a tremor. Run back quickly to the main entrance
room<br>
and past the boulder that smashed into this room earlier. Save
your <br>
game then take a swim.<br>
<br>
You'll find yourself underfire. Larson - your contact at the cafe
is<br>
trying to kill you. Before you finish him off, swim to the bottom
and <br>
find a small tunnel. Follow the tunnel to SECRET #3 and get the
medkit<br>
and magnum clips. Heal yourself then go kick Larson's butt. Enjoy
the<br>
cool movie clip and rest up for the Labyrinth.<br>
<br>
<br>
St. Francis' Folly - Items: 18 - Secrets: 4 - Kills: 21<br>
<br>
Start this level by going right and climbing the wall. Go to the
end <br>
and kill the 2 lions lurking about. Go to the block with the
horseshoe<br>
symbol behind it and pull the block ontop of the symbol to unlock
the<br>
door above you. Push the block forward a couple of times to open
a door<br>
at ground level then push the block again so you can climb on it
later.<br>
<br>
Go through the door and kill the 2 gorillas and pull the switch
across<br>
from the door. Go to the stairs on the right and kill another
gorilla.<br>
Continue up the stairs and throw the switch to open another door.
Go <br>
outside and shoot the other explorer waiting for you in the
pillars. <br>
Dodge a lot and run in circles to shoot him from behind - like
the T-Rex<br>
and Larson. He will run away after eating enough lead. Let him
go! <br>
You can kill him anyway - believe me - I tried!<br>
<br>
Back in the main room - climb onto the block you pushed earlier
then <br>
jump across to another column. Start bunny-hopping these columns
to get<br>
a medkit. Turn left and jump some more to reach the door. Now
comes<br>
the tricky part...<br>
<br>
Stand on the far left of the doorway ontop of the arrows. Jump
left<br>
then jump right and up grabbing the ledge. Standing on the ledge,
face<br>
the smaller of the two sloped ledges and backup. Jump onto the
lower<br>
slope then backward then forward and grab the ledge above you.
Very <br>
tricky but it takes you to SECRET #1 - shotgun shells and a
medkit. <br>
Climb back down to avoid damage taken by falling through broken
floor.<br>
<br>
Back in the main room hop back to the column where you got the
medkit.<br>
Do a long jump to the ledge to the left then turn left and begin
a <br>
series of jumps to reach the door (the one you unlocked from the
floor).<br>
<br>
Go down the hall making sure you are sliding forward! Just before
you<br>
reach the end of the sloped passage jump into the air. You'll
land on<br>
a small ledge below. Jump across to the door and grab it. If you
miss<br>
you cannot try without resetting the level. Get SECRET #2 -
shells and<br>
medkit then turn around and check out that big croc in the water.
You<br>
can kill him if you want but it takes a long time. You can just
as <br>
easily avoid him.<br>
<br>
Jump in and swim forward and up into the first opening to get
SECRET #3<br>
- more shotgun shells. Take another swim and go to the next
opening <br>
where you can pull the switch and drain the water from this
passage.<br>
Drop into the passage and kill the croc (if you didn't already).
He's<br>
easier to shoot now but he's also a lot faster so dodge him
quickly!<br>
<br>
Go to the end of the tunnel and save your game. Jump to the ledge
in<br>
the middle of the room and shoot the 3 bats flying around. Drop
down to<br>
a ledge on your right then once more to the floor below. Pull the
lever<br>
to open the THOR DOOR. Jump to your right and land on the gray
square<br>
to open a secret door. This door is timed so you have to be FAST!<br>
<br>
Turn right and go the the edge. Roll as you land and keep
running.<br>
Roll at the edge and drop down shooting the 2 bats as they
appear. Drop<br>
down once more, taking some minor damage, and enter the secret
door.<br>
SECRET #4 consists of medkit and magnum clips. Exit the room and
find<br>
the save game gem. Save it for now - instead use the switch to
open the<br>
ATLAS DOOR.<br>
<br>
Climb the stairs then jump and grab the ledge. Jump to the ledge
and<br>
get the magnum clips either before or after killing the bat. Jump
back<br>
to the first ledge and move across about half way. Jump and grab
the <br>
middle ledge then go around the left corner and use the switch to
open<br>
the NEPTUNE DOOR.<br>
<br>
Do a REVERSE and jump across to the stairs. Turn around and jump
up to<br>
the ledge with the save game gem and save your game. Enter the
THOR <br>
DOOR to your left. Inside is a cool plasma sphere shooting
electric<br>
bolts to the floor. A pattern of blocks is laid out in a circular
<br>
pattern. If you are in this circle when the bolts hit - you get
zapped!<br>
Time the bolts and make your way across this room.<br>
<br>
The next room has a large hammer suspended from the ceiling and
some<br>
markings on the floor. Stand on the symbol. When you hear
something<br>
break jump back and the hammer will smack the floor. Don't move!
Wait <br>
for a couple of blocks to fall to the floor. Push the block a few
times<br>
against the wall near the head part of Thor's hammer. Use it to
climb <br>
up to the ledge where you can pull the second block out a few
times then<br>
use it to climb and jump over to an even higher ledge.<br>
<br>
Get the small medkit then jump across to the ledge on your left.
Enter<br>
the small room and get the THOR KEY then jump back and climb
down. Run<br>
through the electric room and make your way back and exit the
THOR DOOR.<br>
<br>
At the edge turn left and jump to a ledge that looks slightly
different<br>
than the others. Your friend from earlier is shooting at you so
hop to<br>
a small ledge on your right and kill the 2 bats that are
attacking. <br>
Turn and jump to the middle ledge then go up the stairs to find a
lever<br>
which opens the DAMOCLES DOOR. Climb the stair and enter the
ATLAS DOOR.<br>
<br>
Kill the gorilla waiting for you in here then run ahead and
through the<br>
gate. A medkit is in the pit to your left. Run up the hill until
a<br>
huge boulder comes rumbling towards you. Do a REVERSE and run
away. As<br>
you near the pit do another REVERSE and drop back and grab the
edge of<br>
the pit. The boulder will sail harmlessly overhead. Start back up
the<br>
hill and about half way jump to the ledge on your left. Jump up
again<br>
and get the ATLAS KEY on the other side of the ledge. Make your
way<br>
back and exit the ATLAS DOOR.<br>
<br>
Go to the highest step and jump up and climb to the next level.
Jump to<br>
the stairs on your left. Shoot some bats and go to the highest
step.<br>
Jump to the middle ledge and go to the other side and enter the
NEPTUNE<br>
DOOR. Go for a swim. The current will move you along but you need
to <br>
swim up and to you left to enter a small tunnel. Pull the lever
at the<br>
end of this tunnel then return to the main tunnel. Swim forward
and get<br>
the NEPTUNE KEY. Go to the other side of the passage and surface <br>
quickly as you are probably almost out of air by now.<br>
<br>
Climb out of the water and exit through the NEPTUNE DOOR. Jump to
the<br>
middle ledge and climb down to the ledge across from the
sandstone <br>
stairs. Jump over to the stairs and go down the the DAMOCLES
DOOR. Get<br>
the medkit ontop of the door before you enter.<br>
<br>
Don't worry about those swords hanging from the ceiling. Go to
the next<br>
room and get the DAMOCLES KEY then hoist yourself up and get the
shells<br>
and medkit on the ledge above. Leave this room slowly. The swords
will<br>
start falling - just watch the shadows and listen for them to
fall. If <br>
you walk you will be able to stop just short of the sword. Exit
the<br>
DAMOCLES DOOR drop down onto the small ledge and once more to the
ground<br>
where you can start shooting at the 2 cougars and that hostile
explorer<br>
who's been after you. You can also save your game here (just in
case).<br>
<br>
The cougars will die and the explorer will run away again. Go to
the <br>
door and use the 4 keys you've been collecting in each of the
locks.<br>
The bars will be removed and you can EXIT this huge level. WHEW!<br>
<br>
<br>
Colosseum - Items: 14 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 25<br>
<br>
Start this level by taking a swim. Once the crocodile has seen
you climb<br>
to the bank and shoot the croc. Swim past the croc and exit the
water.<br>
Shoot the 2 lions guarding the area. Enter the temple and start
up the<br>
stairs. Jump back and kill a third lion that surprises you
(unless you<br>
read this first). <br>
<br>
Exit the temple and proceed down the left side. Climb up the
rocky ledge<br>
and jump over to the temple. Follow the ledge to the right to get
a med-<br>
kit. Return the way you came and climb onto the block. Jump up
onto the<br>
next ledge and follow it around the temple. You will have to jump
along<br>
the way. At the end of the ledge jump diagnally to a hidden door.<br>
<br>
Before going in walk forward and slide down the slope. Jump when
you<br>
reach the bottom to land on a small ledge then look to the left
of the<br>
water for a hidden passage. Do a running jump into the passage
and get<br>
SECRET #1 - shotgun shells. Make your way back to the door and go
in.<br>
<br>
At the edge of the pit kill the 2 crocs and get the medkit in the
corner.<br>
Use the ramp to climb out of the pit then face the wall, jump and
grab<br>
the crack in the wall. Shimmy to the right until you can climb up
then<br>
go forward to SECRET #2 - more shotgun shells. Go back to the
crevice <br>
and do a safety drop and shimmy right until you can drop to the
ledge.<br>
Walk up the ramp and start down the tunnel until you can drop
down a hole<br>
and enter the temple.<br>
<br>
Enter the Colosseum to your right and shoot the Lion, Cougar and
Gorilla<br>
from your safe vantage point. During your target practice that
guy from<br>
the last level starts shooting again. Fire at him until he runs
away.<br>
Jump into the pit on the left and save your game. Climb out of
the pit<br>
and use the door at the back corner. Slide down the ramp and
shoot the<br>
2 lions waiting for you. Go to the far wall and use the switch to
open<br>
the Colosseum gate. Turn around and pull the switch to open the
door <br>
next to it. Head down this corridor and into a pit.<br>
<br>
Four cougars patrol the top of this pit. You can kill them by
jumping and<br>
shooting them at the top of your jumps. It's dirty but it works.
Climb<br>
out of the pit when you've killed 1 or 2 of them. That way they
can't<br>
gang up on you. Head to the rocks and slide down the ramp. Go to
the<br>
back of the room and turn right and stand on the gray floor
panel.<br>
<br>
Turn back and head to the right gate to get the medkit. Run back
and <br>
when the gate closes stand on the floor panel again to open the
left gate<br>
which you can then enter and use the switch. Then run around the
corner<br>
and enter the right gate then through the second gate which is on
a timer<br>
(so hurry)!<br>
<br>
Pull the switch in here to open the white door in the chamber. Go
back<br>
outside and enter the white door. Go down the slope and save your
game<br>
at the spikes. Go through the door and climb all the ledges to
the top<br>
of the Colosseum. Turn left and head up the slope then climb the
ledge<br>
and go right to find some shells.<br>
<br>
Go back down the rocks to the ledge and stand as far from the pit
as <br>
possible facing the rocky slide to the left of the Colosseum
door. Do a<br>
long jump to the slope and climb up the rocks. When you reach
level <br>
ground turn left and jump to the ledge. Go forward then turn
right to<br>
kill the 2 gorillas in the bedroom.<br>
<br>
Go into the next room with the stairs and the block. Pull the
block <br>
until you can enter the tunnel behind it. Its dark in here but
there<br>
is a medkit and a switch - you know what to do with both. Return
to <br>
the rock slide and slide down backwards.<br>
<br>
Go to your right around the rocks then turn left and proceed to
the<br>
ledge at the corner of the Colosseum. Climb the ledge and go up
some<br>
stairs and turn right. Enter the door and shoot the 2 bats and
head for<br>
the light. The gate shuts behind you. Roll into the pit as a
boulder<br>
crashes into the gate. WHEW! Climb out of the pit and jump to the
other<br>
side. Follow the passage to the next switch and use it to open
the door<br>
around the corner. Go through this door and exit the dark room to
your<br>
left.<br>
<br>
Proceed across the Colosseum floor shooting the cougar that
awaits. You<br>
will soon come across that guy again so pump him full of lead
until he<br>
runs away again. Keep advancing and go up the stairs and enter
the door.<br>
Go forward into the lit room. The exit to this room is on a short
timer<br>
and only opens when you walk past a certain pillar.<br>
<br>
Position yourself to the right of the left pillar and get against
the <br>
wall. The door should be on your right. Run forward and jump onto
the<br>
block trying to land on the right side. Immediately side-jump to
the<br>
right then do a backflip then side-jump left and one more jump
forward<br>
and through the door (Takes as long to perfect as it did to
figure out).<br>
<br>
SECRET #3 has 2 medkits, Uzi clips and the long awaited Magnums -
hope<br>
it was worth the effort! Back at the ledge turn left and jump
across to<br>
the switch which opens a door. Proceed to the bottom and exit out
to the<br>
Colosseum and enter the next door.<br>
<br>
Climb up to the door you just opened and take a swim into the
next room.<br>
There you can push the block forward into the next room. Enter
and save<br>
your game. Get the medkit and use the switch to open the door at
the <br>
bottom of those stairs earlier in the game (above the rock
slide). Pull<br>
the block until you can get behind it and get the Rusty Key. Swim
back<br>
through the tunnel and drop into the dark room and use the right
door <br>
along the Colosseum wall. Watch out for that guy - he may or may
not be<br>
back to take a few cheap shots at you.<br>
<br>
Drop to the Colosseum floor and head back to the block ledge in
the far<br>
corner. Kill the lurking gorilla along the way. Go to the edge of
the<br>
pit and drop off backwards and hang. Shimmy until your shadow is
between<br>
spike then drop. Enter the door with the rocks and climb to the
top so<br>
you can do that long jump to the rock slide all over again. Go
back to<br>
the bedchamber (where you killed the 2 gorillas) and use the
Rusty Key<br>
to open the gate.<br>
<br>
Enter the gate and go swimming and enter the first hole which
leads to<br>
a room with a switch. After pulling the switch go swimming again
and <br>
keep swimming down the tunnel until the level is over.<br>
<br>
<br>
Palace Midas - Items: 21 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 42<br>
<br>
You're already swimming when you start this level so climb out of
the <br>
pool and head for the tunnel between the pillars. Kill the 2
gorillas<br>
then run ahead and through the left door. Three more gorillas
await <br>
your gunfire in this room. Pick up the medkit and enter the door
and<br>
save your game. Use the switch to open a an unseen gate then run
back<br>
down the tunnel and shoot 2 more gorilla near the left door.
Return<br>
back to the pool where you started and shoot the crocodile to
your left.<br>
<br>
Go down the corridor and turn right and keep off the stairs.
Continue<br>

between the<br>
wall and the cliff. Kill the gorilla around the corner then get
the <br>
magnum clips from inside this small space.<br>
<br>
Turn right and move forward until 2 lions attack. Kill them and
continue<br>
until you reach a wall then turn right and shoot 3 bats and get

the<br>
medkit and the magnum clips then jump back to the first ledge
then back<br>
to the pillar.<br>
<br>
Use running jumps to cross the series of pillars. At the last one
turn <br>
right and jump to the ledge with 5 switches. Activate the left
switch<br>
then turn and drop into a pit and use the switch there to open
the gate.<br>
Enter and turn left then left again entering a brightly lit door
and a <br>
dead gorilla. Enter the torch room and save your game. Step on
the <br>
lowered section of the floor and watch the torches go out.
Quickly make<br>
a series of jumps across the torches. If you take to long they
light<br>
themselves (AND YOU)! Jump into the water below to put yourself
out if <br>
you do catch on fire. Kill the water rats before coming up to try
again.<br>
Grab the last pillar and pull yourself up as the flame ignites.
You can<br>
beat the fire if you are fast enough. Get the lead bar and save
your <br>
game here.<br>
<br>
Swim to the stairs and climb up and shoot the gorilla. Go through
the <br>
gate and around to the wall of switches. Climb up and use the 2nd
switch<br>
from the right, the middle switch and return the left switch back
to the<br>
UP position. Drop down and enter the gate turning left and
through a new<br>
door between some pillars. Go through this room and into a tunnel
then<br>
go down some stairs on the right. Pull the block out of the wall
to <br>
shake things up a bit then head back up the stairs and continue
up the<br>
next set of stairs. The door at the top opens into a room with
large<br>
pillars. Jump over to the right to a dark patch then jump again
to the<br>
center column then jump again to the left of the sandy ledge.
Jump left<br>
again and enter the door and climb up to save your game.<br>
<br>
Continue to the next room and kill everything that moves. Jump
across <br>
and into the pool and head down the trench shooting the 2 crocs
that will<br>
eventualy show themselves. When you reach the end of the water
climb out<br>
and climb on the rocks to your right. Advance until Lara cannot
go any<br>
further then jump forward twice. You will slide back down if you
don't<br>
jump twice in a row. SECRET #1 - medkit and magnum clips wait for
you to<br>
the left.<br>
<br>
Jump in the water and swim to the left and climb out. Climb onto
the<br>
rail and go to the corner with the small medkit below. Do the
safety<br>
drop below to get SECRET #2 - shotgun shells, uzi clips and
medkit. Jump<br>
out of the pit and kill the gorilla then move ahead and begin
searching<br>
the small niches in the wall until you find the medkit. Head back
to<br>
the main alcove that leads to the ledge and jump over to it. Run
along <br>
the ledge and kill 2 more gorillas then move to the next to the
last <br>
alcove. Face the wall and jump to the crevice grabbing on then
shimmy to<br>
the left and drop onto the ledge. Kill the bat then turn and jump
over <br>
to the door. Proceed up the long tunnel until you reach the hex
shaped<br>
passage. Run down this collapsible tunnel and get the medkit then
turn<br>
and climb out of the tunnel. Skid down the long slope and climb
back<br>
down until you reach the room where you started. You'll be on a
ledge <br>
and a cougar will be coming at you. Kill him before he even gets
close<br>
then run along the ledge and into the door on the other side.<br>
<br>
Follow the tunnel then jump into the left window and out onto a
ledge<br>
where you can turn right and make a running jump across. Turn
right and<br>
go up to the pool and take a swim into the next room avoiding the
big<br>
crocodile swimming in here with you.<br>
<br>
Exit the water and climb onto the rock avoiding the almost
invisible gap<br>
and shoot the bat. Jump over the gap - if you fall in you get to
repeat<br>
about 10 minutes as you make your way around to this point again
- and<br>
pick up the lead bar and save your game. Jump to the ledge below
and<br>
shoot the lions. Go down the stairs and into the tunnel then turn
left<br>
and go to the entrance room. Go left and make your way back to
the room<br>
with 5 switches. Use the right switch and return the second to
the right<br>
switch to its UP position. Drop down and left and find the new
door and<br>
the floor full of spikes.<br>
<br>
WALK through the spikes and around the ramp where you can pull
another <br>
block a couple times to reveal a tunnel and another switch to
use. Head<br>
back up the ramp and the stair. At the top go to the corner and
do a <br>
standing jump over the spikes to the column. Make a series of
jumps to<br>
cross this room starting with the column on your right. When you
reach<br>
the last column jump into the door then jump right back to the
column.<br>
<br>
You can now safely shoot the gorilla who just woke up in the room
beyond<br>
that door. When he's dead enter the room and get the lead bar.
Jump <br>
back to the pillar then down to the door below taking a small
amount of<br>
damage. Return the the 5 switches and move the middle switch UP
and the<br>
far left switch DOWN then return to the start room with the pool.
Head<br>
down the stairs and into the garden.<br>
<br>
Kill the 2 gorillas and get the medkit off the roof near the
back. You<br>
can get to the roof by climbing the wall on the right. On the
roof turn<br>
and head down the passage to the MIDAS Chamber. Stand next to the
stone<br>
hand and use the lead bars to turn them to GOLD! Climb up the
right side<br>
of the MIDAS stone and save your game. Return to the garden and
go to <br>
the right corner next to the gate. Walk sideways behind the tree
to find<br>
the concealed lever to open the gate and the final SECRET #3.

step along<br>
the wall. Kill the giant rat then dive in the water behind him.
Swim to<br>
the next room and exit the water shooting the cougar. Enter the
tunnel<br>
and use the switch to open the gate then save your game.<br>

they are<br>
both dead. Jump to the crevice on your left and grab on and
shimmy to <br>
the right and climb up to the gate. Enter and get the Gold Key
and the<br>
medkit then go back to the dead cougar. Enter the tunnel and use

a <br>
series of jumps to cross these blocks and get the medkit before
entering<br>
the door.<br>
<br>
Enter the room on the left with the writing on the floor and pull
the <br>
block out of the wall and place it on the writing. Kill the
gorilla that<br>
appears from behind the block then get the shells and magnum clip
he was<br>
guarding. Go back and pull the block until its on the writing
next to <br>
the door. Shoot the gorilla that comes out of a newly opened door
then<br>
go get the shotgun shells. Go back and climb ontop of the block
and jump<br>
to the door above. Run through the veg-o-matic and get the medkit
and <br>
Rusty Key then return to the main room. Push the block away from
the <br>
ledge then circle around and pull it onto the writing. Rats
attack so<br>
climb/jump onto the block and shoot them from safety. Enter the
new room<br>
and get the medkit then go back and push the block onto the final
writing<br>
tile. Go to the door and IGNORE the medkit - its a trap. Run
straight<br>
through and climb and get the Rusty Key. Get the medkit on your
way back<br>
out.<br>
<br>
Go back to the main room with the door with locks on each side
and use<br>
your Rusty Keys. Enter and save your game then jump to the right
of the<br>
ramp. Do a series of jumps up to a secret passage then jump
across a<br>
series of collapsible panels to SECRET #2. Here is the jump combo
that<br>
worked for me: Turn so Lara's right side is facing the first tile
then<br>
jump RIGHT - FORWARD - RIGHT - RIGHT - RIGHT - BACK - RIGHT
ending up in<br>
the secret room. Get the uzi and magnum clips then return to the
ramp.<br>
<br>
Slide down and into the water and swim through the tunnel exiting
onto a<br>
ledge where you can shoot a croc. Enter the tunnel and climb all
the<br>
ledges to reach the top then slide down to the ledge in the sand.
Slide<br>
down the ramp on your right and jump to the ledge then climb up
to the<br>
switch and open the underwater gate.<br>
<br>
Take a dive and swim into the next room and exit before a large
temple.<br>
Swim under the temple and find the hidden tunnel in the rear. You
will<br>
surface inside where you can save your game and use the switch to
open<br>
the main door. Swim back outside and exit to the left of the
temple on<br>
the sand. LOOK OUT!!<br>
<br>
A statue comes to life and starts throwing fireballs at you. Jump
around<br>
and dodge his attacks while pumping lead into him until he dies.
Save<br>
your game then enter the temple. Its finally time to take care of
your<br>
sniper friend (his name is Pierre) so ready your magnums and take
care of<br>
business! When he hits the floor remove the magnums, Gold Key and
the <br>
Scion piece from him. Climb to the ledge above and get he medkit
and the<br>
magnum clips. Use the Gold Key to open the door below and you are
free<br>
to EXIT this level. You can wander back outside and take on the
other<br>
statue if you are feeling daring today!<br>

<br>
Exit the water between the palm trees and climb to the ledge

a tunnel with shells, a Sapphire Key and a save game gem. <br>
<br>
Go to the block between the sphinx's legs and pull it out until
you can<br>
enter the tunnel behind it where you can use the Sapphire Key to
open the<br>
door. Go down the passage to the next room and go right and up to

going and<br>
shoot the croc then hang and drop off the ledge by the phoenix.

for SECRET #1 - magnum clips and a medkit.<br>
<br>
Take a swim in the corner and flip the switch below to open the

continue forward and up out of the water before the croc eats
you. Kill<br>
him from the safety of the ledge then go to the ledge below the
gate and<br>
climb up. Push the block towards the save gem 2 times then get on
it and<br>
jump to the ledge below the door. Pull yourself up and go up the
steps.<br>
Jump up into the tunnel and use the wall switch to extend a gold
bridge<br>
in the previous room.<br>
<br>
Return to the room and jump back to the block and push the block
back to<br>
its original position then pull it once toward the water then go

other side and push it once. Save your game if you haven't
already then<br>
go stand on the block and jump across to the ledge with the block
on it.<br>
Ready your magnums and push the block to open a hidden door.
Enter and <br>
kill the cat-mummy then use the switch to open a door in the
ceiling <br>
above the golden bridge. Return to the ledge and pull the block

in the ceiling and use the switch up there to open the door by
the cat<br>

the corners but don't use the light switch yet! Drop to the
darkness<br>
below and shoot 2 more panthers then head for the lit passage and
get the<br>
medkit.<br>
<br>
Go to the back of the room and look up at the ledge just to the

the bridge. Its very hard to see in the dark but it is there.
Climb up<br>
to it then turn and jump to the left onto the bridge. Cross over

middle ledge and go to the left and shoot the panthers below.
Jump to <br>

<br>
Jump back on the bridge and make your way back down to the floor.

don't fall - instead shimmy to your right before dropping to the
next<br>
ledge. Turn and fall back off the ledge and grab on then shimmy
to the<br>

Follow<br>
the passage on your left and use the switch to access the last
bridge in<br>
this level.<br>
<br>
Return to the mummy room and jump over to the ledge then drop to
the <br>
ground and go between the 2 chairs. Climb the ledge and keep on
climbing<br>
unti you reach the green ledge. Enter the door and cross the
bridge to<br>
get the Scarab. Hop to the bridge on your left and get the Seal
of <br>
Anibus to open an underwater door. Drop into the water and swim
for the<br>
tunnel. Its a long one so fill your lungs before entering. <br>
<br>
Go to the bottom and then forward to the second set of alcoves
and get <br>
the magnum clips on the left. Proceed the next set of alcoves and
take a<br>
medkit and shotgun shells on your right. Continue down until you

can also use.<br>
<br>
Climb the stairs in the left corner and follow the passage. Kill
the<br>
mummy from the safety of the large mound then get the medkit on
the left<br>
side of the mound. Jump to and climb the steps on the right side
of the<br>
mound. At the top you can drop into the Sphinx room from the last
level.<br>
Go to the palm trees and find the pillar that you can use your 4
new<br>
artifacts on. A door opens to the left of the Sphinx and you can
EXIT!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sanctuary of Scion - Items: 28 - Secrets: 1 - Kills: 15<br>
<br>
Start this level by getting some ammo for your magnums (which you
should be<br>
using full time now). Dash up the stairs and waste the 2 mummies
up top<br>
and load up on magnum ammo. Jump to the room above then go
forward and<br>
right and slide down the slope and kill the mummy at the bottom.
Hop up on<br>
the slanted block next to the lit pillar then climb to your left
and jump<br>
backwards onto the pillar above.<br>
<br>
With the wall on your left leap to the next pillar then advance
until you<br>
can reach the crevice in the wall. Grab it and shimmy to the
right and <br>
drop down. Go up the steps to the right and jump across several
pillars<br>
ending on a ledge with some more magnum clips. Do 3 jumps forward
from<br>
this ledge to end at some stairs. Go down the stairs and flip the
switch<br>
to open a door below. <br>
<br>
The flapping you should be hearing is a demon. Shoot him as soon
as he<br>
is in range and do not let up until one of you is dead. If he
reaches<br>
the platform he could knock you off. Get next to the edge by the
switch<br>
and leap forward to a tiny ledge. Get some shells then jump to
the left<br>
grabbing and pulling yourself up to some more shells. Jump to the
next<br>
ledge then jump off and do a safety drop to the ledge below. Turn
and<br>
jump to the sandy ledge then drop off backwards and slide down
grabbing <br>
on to the end of the slide and dropping safely down. Get the
magnum <br>
clips from between the Sphinx paws then find the 2 slanted spires
in the<br>
corner.<br>
<br>
Climb on the right block then jump to the left then jump to the
ledge and<br>
one more jump to the pillar and pull yourself up. Now turn left
and jump<br>
to the next pillar and another jump to a curving ledge above.
Save your<br>
game then run past the veg-o-matic to your right and get the
medkit. <br>
Follow the path to the next switch and use it to open a door and
summon <br>
another demon. Kill him quickly then return to the switch and
jump to <br>
the ledge on the right and get the medkit. Turn and jump and grab
the <br>
ledge pulling yourself back up to the switch then return to the
curved<br>
ledge with the pillar below.<br>
<br>
Do a safety drop to the pillar then face the corner and jump over
the <br>
pillar to a slope where you can slide back to the Sphinx. Enter
the<br>
passage to the left of the Sphinx and get some ammo for the
magnum then<br>
enter the passage to the left. When you get to the ramp turn and
jump<br>
back to begin the slide. Grab the end of the ramp as you fall
then <br>
shimmy to the ledge on the left and get the magnum clips. Climb
all the<br>
stairs on the right then go down the slope and dive for the Gold
Key.<br>
Exit the water next to the stairs in the corner and return to the
top of<br>
the stairs.<br>
<br>
This time jump instead of sliding down the slope and grab the
bridge. <br>
Use the Gold Key in the right lock to open the door. Enter this
new room<br>
and start blasting the Centaur. Get the Ankh and the medkit and
save the<br>
game before jumping off the bridge. Climb down all those stairs
and dive<br>
into the water climbing out at the stairs in the corner and
return to the<br>
Sphinx. Climb on that tilted ledge in front of the Sphinx then
climb up<br>
to the next one and jump backwards to a third ledge. Climb up to
the <br>
magnum clips then jump to and follow the sandy ledge.<br>
<br>
When you reach a wall turn left and jump to the next ledge and
continue<br>
forward jumping to another ledge at the end. Climb the ledge to
your<br>
left and jump to a rock ledge and continue all the way until you
reach <br>
the Save Gem. Enter the tunnel and push the block on your right
so you <br>
can get around it. Get on the block and climb to the ledge above
it and<br>
kill the Centaur. Get his Ankh and the medkit and return to the
ledge<br>
above the Sphinx. Slide down the long ramp to your right and get
the <br>
medkit. Drop onto the Sphinx and kill the panther-mummy then
climb onto<br>
the tilted ledge and jump to the small space at the rear of the
Sphinx's<br>
head. <br>
<br>
Go forward and climb to the top of the Sphinx and use the Ankh.
Drop <br>
down to the front and use the other Ankh and save your game.
Climb back<br>
to the top and walk along the left side of the head until you
can't go<br>
any further. Look down to a magical clip floating in the air.
Jump over<br>
to it and land on an invisible ledge. You just got the ONLY
SECRET in <br>
this level but since its the long awaited UZI that's okay! Get
the ammo<br>
to go with your new toy then jump across to the ledge on the
cliff.<br>
<br>
Two demons appear so ready your new toy and let the lead fly.
When they<br>
are dead you can return to the ground and enter the door between
the<br>
Sphinx's legs. Take a swim going deep and to the left for some
shells<br>
then go between the statues and get the Uzi Ammo. Surface and
recharge<br>
that air meter then dive down to the right statue and enter the
passage<br>
between its feet. Use the switch and let the current take you to
the<br>
surface. Climb onto the low pillar and jump to the other one then
jump<br>
to the steps on the right. Go up the stairs and slide down into a
dark<br>
cave.<br>
<br>
There is a demon and a Save Gem so save your game quickly then
take care<br>
of the demon. Facing the head on the left do a safety drop to the
ledge<br>
below then turn and jump to the ledge by the head. Walk to the
right<br>
facing the head and drop down. Facing left, jump back and slide
down the<br>
ramp. Dive in the water and climb to the right statue and use the
switch<br>
on his chest to open a door. Dive back in and this time swim into
the<br>
tunnel between the feet of the left statue.<br>
<br>
When you surface, run up the long slope and get the magnum clips
on your<br>
way and get the Scarab at the top. Now go into the room where you
began<br>
this level and fight 2 panther-mummies and a Centaur. Use the
Scarab in<br>
the lock after the bloodbath is over and enter through the gate
taking<br>
the medkit and magnum clips. (who leaves all this ammo lying
around?)<br>
<br>
Go down the slope and climb up through the hole into the Scion
room. <br>
Larson is back and just begging for you to kill him. Help him out
with <br>
a few rounds of gunfire then go up the stairs to the Scion. EXIT
this<br>
level and prepare to enter the Lost Continent of Atlantis.<br>
<br>
<br>
Natla's Mines - Items: 26 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 3<br>
<br>
Lara begins this level underwater and stripped of all weapons.
Swim for<br>
the waterfall and surface behind it. Go down the tunnel and use
the <br>
switch on the left to open a door. Go back to the falls and dive
in and<br>
swim to the other side. Climb out and enter the tunnel to the
right of <br>
the crate. Find the block and pull it out of the mound then enter
the<br>
passage it was blocking. Use the switch to open a second door
then<br>
return to the water and the boat.<br>
<br>
Swim back to the falls and go down that passage again. Climb to
the <br>
sloped passage and follow it until you can jump to a ledge with a<br>
barricade it. Follow the tunnel to a room with a large glass
structure.<br>
Get the medkit then enter the next room with the two condemned
houses.<br>
Find and pull the block out twice towards some tires then hop
ontop and<br>
jump to the roof of the house. You'll fall through and end up
inside<br>
where you can go down a tunnel and use a switch to make the boat
return<br>
to the dock.<br>
<br>
Go to the end of the tunnel and slide down grabbing the right
ledge and<br>
dropping to the ground. Follow the tracks to the wood door which
opens<br>
for you. Now comes the TRICKY PART! Do this exactly!<br>
<br>
- Walk towards the first barricade until the boulder begins to
roll.<br>
- Jump the first barricade then do a series of running jumps to
get over<br>
the other 3.<br>
- As you jump the 3rd barricade turn to the right in mid-air to
land on<br>
a hill and enter the passage before the boulder flattens you.<br>
<br>
If you were successful then Indiana Jones would be proud,
otherwise you<br>
will need to return to the first barricade and try again. <br>
<br>
Inside the tunnel get the fuse then go left and save your game.
Head up<br>
until another boulder starts rollings then run back and to the
left. Go<br>
up the hill on the left as another boulder rolls by. Drop into
the hole<br>
at the top to reenter the room with 2 boulders. Climb the hill to
get<br>
back to those two houses and make your way back to the water with
the<br>
boat. Swim over and climb into the boat then leap over to the
crates. <br>
Climb up the left crate and find the tunnel behind it. Inside are
lots<br>
of NATLA boxes and one of them is a &quot;movable block&quot;.
Pull it once then<br>
push it left. Now pull the box behind it out twice and pull it
right to<br>
gain access to a passage with another switch. Use it to activate
the<br>
giant drill machine. <br>
<br>
Return to the docks and go to tunnel to the right of the crates
that the<br>
drill machine HAD been blocking. Find and push a block forward
until you<br>
can enter the next room. Get on the block and then climb up
through a<br>
hole to find another switch that opens another door. Grab some
ammo for<br>
your Uzi (in case you get it back) then drop back down. Go
forward and<br>
into the next room and get another fuse then return to the docks
and make<br>
your way back to those two houses. Go inside the left one and
follow the<br>
tunnel inside to the fork where you can go left and use the
switch to<br>
start the conveyor belt. Go back to the fork and find the 3rd
fuse then<br>
return to the room with the glass structure and enter it from the
right.<br>
<br>
Get some magnum ammo and save your game then use the 3 fuses in
the<br>
slots to gain access to a new house. Enter the house and get the
pistols<br>
before climbing to the roof and jumping into the tunnel. Just
inside is<br>
a hole which you can jump to and climb up. A gate will open
leading to<br>
a deadly trap. The obvious trap door below will plunge you into
hot lava<br>
if you stand on it so instead - slide down the slope backwards
and grab<br>
the edge as you fall. Climb back up and the door will shut and
stay shut<br>
from now on. Cross and get SECRET #1 - shells and Uzi clips then
use the<br>
switch to open the gate and return to the first tunnel.<br>
<br>
Go to the end of the tunnel and do a safety drop to the Save Gem
then <br>
swim to the docks. Exit the water and enter the tunnel with the
drill<br>
machine. Go around the NATLA box and into the next tunnel where
you find<br>
your magnums. Too bad some guy is using them to blast you. Kill
him<br>
as quickly as possible and try not to fall in the lava tubes. If
he runs<br>
then chase him. Once he is dead take your hard earned magnums
back and<br>
heal yourself.<br>
<br>
Leap towards the switch on the far wall. You just miss the ledge
but you<br>
can grab the ledge below taking a good amount of damage. Slide
down the<br>
hill and grab the bottom edge. Let go and grab again to grip the
crevice<br>
just below and shimmy to the ledge on your right. Enter the lava
room on<br>
the right and jump to the ledge on the left. Now begin a series
of <br>
tricky (and deadly) jumps from pillar to pillar until you can
jump into<br>
the tunnel on the right wall.<br>
<br>
Go forward and push the block quickly to avoid the boulder
rumbling <br>
towards you. Once that's over you can pull the block back and get
on it<br>
to access SECRET #2 - Uzi clips and a medkit. Run down the tunnel
in the<br>
corner and drop to some more tracks. Take the medkit and the Uzi
clips <br>
and grab the Shotgun (if you really think you'll need it). Go
back to<br>
the previous room and drop down the hole behind the boulder then
leap to<br>
the pillar in the lava tunnel. Turn right and do a series of
jumps across<br>
three pillars then drop and enter the tunnel below. Slide to the
bottom <br>
of the slope then jump to the ledge. Climb up and enter the room
with <br>
the TNT. Fine the one that's not like the others. Pull it into
the next<br>
room - out once - right once - then 3 pulls into the next room.
Now jump<br>
(or climb) over it and push it 3 times until you can get on it
and jump<br>
into the tunnel with the Save Gem.<br>
<br>
Go to the top and climb to the ledge then do a leap to the ledge
on the<br>
right. Wait for the tunnel to spit out another boulder then leap
into it<br>
and follow it to the switch. Get the magnum clips and use the
switch to<br>
create a cave-in in the TNT room. Now return to the room with the
TNT<br>
box. Go to the new hole on the left and enter the passage. This
next <br>
room has your Uzi's but once again - they are being used for
EVIL. Some<br>
punk-ass kid on a skateboard is taking cheap shots at you. He's
fast but<br>
he doesn't attack often so waste him with your magnums and take
back your<br>
Uzi's. You should now have ALL your weapons back!! Scattered
about this<br>
room are 3 Uzi clips so retrieve them then start checking out the
holes<br>
<br>
One of the holes has water instead of lava. Dive in and swim
through the<br>
gate to get SECRET #3 - variety of medkits and Uzi clips. Make
your way<br>
back to the skateboard park then go all the way up the hill to
save your<br>
game. Follow the tunnel into the next room and start up the
slope. Of<br>
course 3 boulders make this harder than it needed to be. Each
boulder<br>
has its own section of the slope so stay in the middle. When the
first <br>
one comes at ya jump left. When #2 starts rolling jump right then
back <br>
to the middle when #3 starts to roll. Stop at the top and wait
for a<br>
forth boulder to spit out the door.<br>
<br>
Enter the passage and go up the slope and climb up to the next
room. Get<br>
on the low pillar and jump to the higher one then jump to the
ledge. Do<br>
another jump to the left then another jump to the left then climb
into <br>
the room on the right. Push the block twice and enter the next
room then<br>
push the block twice and drop down into the lower room. Pull the
block<br>
then go back up and drop down on the other side of the block.
Push it <br>
forward to reveal a Save Gem and a switch. Use it to open a yet
unseen<br>
door. Turn left at the switch and enter the alcove straight
ahead. Go<br>
left and climb then move forward to the block and enter the
passage at <br>
the left. Push the block at the bottom of the stairs once then
turn left<br>
and make a mad dash for the door which closes before you get
there!<br>
<br>
Use the switch next to the door then head back upstairs, past the
gold<br>
door and drop through the hole. Run through the doors and ready
your<br>
favorite weapon for another shootout. He's packing a shotgun so
keep <br>
your distance. I recommend magnums at 30 paces and dance like
crazy!<br>
When he's just a red spot on the floor relieve him of his shotgun
and <br>
then proceed to climb to the ledge above the door into the
pyramid.<br>
<br>
Jump from ledge to ledge all the way up this sucker. At the top
jump to<br>
the left wall and slide down the pyramid and find the tunnel.
Enter and<br>
use the switch to open the door then exit and slide to the
bottom. Go<br>
back to the maze and enter the Gold Door to get a medkit and the
keys to<br>
the Pyramid. Now go to the Pyramid and use the Pyarmid key to
enter the<br>
pyramid and EXIT this level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Atlantis - Items: 43 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 26<br>
<br>
Wait for the lights to come on then advance into this room. A
monster<br>
explodes from a sphere so kill it with your magnums then go to
the right<br>
and kill the monster in the second sphere. Follow the trench and
kill a<br>
third creature that blasts from a sphere and get the Uzi ammo.
Enter the<br>
door to the left of the center door and enter a room with a
webbed floor.<br>
<br>
Get the medkit from the corner then cross the center bridge to
the left.<br>
Get the shotgun shells and prepare to kill a demon that was just
released.<br>
Kill him from up here if possible. If you drop a dog explodes
from a<br>
sphere and just adds to the confusion. Use the switch in the far
right<br>
corner of the webbed room then turn around and run to another
switch in <br>
the opposite wall and use it. Run back to the other side and go
through<br>
the door and down the stairs and trip another switch to open that
center<br>
door back at the entrance room.<br>
<br>
Return to the center door killing any leftover creatures running
around.<br>
Enter and kill the flying monster while staying in the safety of
the <br>
tunnel. Exit to the ledge and reverse and drop off and down to
the block<br>
below grabbing onto it. Climb up and get SECRET #1 - clips for
the Uzi <br>
and magnum and a medkit. Go through the tunnel and climb up the
ledge and<br>
drop down the hole. Turn and go down the passage to a webbed
ledge then<br>
turn and jump and grab the crevice at its lowest part. Shimmy and
drop to<br>
the tunnel below grabbing the entrance and climb up into it. Flip
the<br>
switch in this tunnel and get the Uzi ammo then jump to the
webbed ledge.<br>
<br>
Leap from the end of this ledge to the next and grab on as a
sphere blows<br>
up below you. Climb up and use the Save Gem in this tunnel. Leap
to the<br>
pillar then leap to the darker ledge to the left on the pyramid.
Jump to<br>
the next ledge avoiding the rumbling boulder coming at you. Jump
to the<br>
next ledge on your right...just missed it! After your slide is
over you <br>
can now climb the next set of ledges all the way to the top right
corner<br>
using a series of standing jumps.<br>
<br>
Enter the tunnel and get SECRET #2 - clips for Uzi and Magnum and
medkit.<br>
Exit and slide down to the red door and turn right and jump to
the ledge<br>
and grab and climb up. Jump to the second ledge and get the
medkit then<br>
jump to the next ledge and pull yourself up and into the tunnel.
Load up<br>
on Uzi clips and use the switch then go back to the water and
dive in.<br>
<br>
Find and use the switch underwater to open the red door then exit
the <br>
water by climbing onto the small ledge on the left side of the
slope then<br>
climb to the pillar and jump back to the pyramid. Retrace your
path back<br>
to the red door and get inside before it shuts. Jump to the ledge
and go<br>
up some stairs jumping into the door. Climb up the passage saving
your<br>
game and jumping some spikes on the way. Dive in the water and go
down<br>
into the underwater chamber and get some shells then use the
switch and <br>
swim through the door and back up to the surface. Get the Uzi
clips after<br>
you dash through the veg-o-matic then go right and leap to the
next ledge.<br>
<br>
Ignore those clips for now as a demon is ready to pounce. Dart
inside the<br>
tunnel and kill him from a safer place then get the Uzi clips
after he is<br>
dead. Turn back and dive into the water at the other end of the
tunnel.<br>
Swim between the two spheres and climb to the ledge and use the
switch in<br>
the right corner to open a door. Now go left and use the switch
around <br>
the corner to open another door and use the Save Gem.<br>
<br>
As you near the sphere in the right corner a monster explodes
from it so<br>
kill it then go use the switch in the remaining corner to open
the last<br>
underwater door. Dive in and go through the long corridor with
the 3 open<br>
doors. Exit into a dark tunnel and go up the ramp on your left.
Turn <br>
right at the red passage and flip the switch to open the door and
get the<br>
Uzi ammo.<br>
<br>
Find the block across from the boulder and pull it out then push
it against<br>
the left wall. Return to the red door and switch and use the
switch again<br>
and enter the door. Your strategically placed block stop the
boulder and<br>
you can now enter the tunnel it was blocking. Kill the demon as
you walk<br>
onto the ledge then jump to the right ledge and ignore the Save
Gem. The<br>
tunnel leads to a room with with 2 demons in spheres. Release
only one at<br>
a time and back into the tunnel to kill them from safety. Go back
and use<br>
the Save Gem you passed a few minutes/demons ago.<br>
<br>
Now slide down the slope and jump as you near the bottom. Try to
land on a<br>
red ledge as anything else will dump you into some spikes. Get
the shells<br>
and the medkit and all that Uzi ammo then enter the next room
through the<br>
tunnel. Go right and go to the ledge to wake up another demon
then run<br>
back to the tunnel to kill it. Now go back and jump to the left
ledge and<br>
then jump to the small ledge after that. Get into the tunnel on
the right<br>
quickly to attack another demon. You can now go back out and jump
to the<br>
glowing yellow slop in the center of this room.<br>
<br>
Leap to the rock ledge then get the Uzi clips and use the switch
up on the<br>
slope. Turn and go until the ledge tilts. Jump over it and pull
on the <br>
block to open a tunnel. Run past the veg-o-matic and kill the 2
demons on<br>
the other side. Jump over to the dead demons and head up the
tunnel and<br>
climb some stairs to get Uzi clips and a medkit. Go to the ledge
on the<br>
right and kill the monster flying around in here then go left and
jump to<br>
the ledge on the left. Enter the tunnel and save your game.<br>
<br>
Leap to the ledge in the corner and enter another tunnel and use
the switch<br>
before going back to the lava room. Jump over to the first ledge
then jump<br>
to the pillar on the left. Do another jump to the next left
pillar and <br>
then a flying leap into the door. Climb up and use the switch at
the end<br>
of the passage. Return to the ledge and do a series of jumps to
cross the<br>
pillars and reach the tunnel. Proceed up the passage and go into
the <br>
corner of the room to activate a secret door. Run up the hill on
the left<br>
with Uzi's blazing and kill the 3 attacking creatures.<br>
<br>
Enter the alcove on the right for SECRET #3 - shells, medkit and
Uzi clips.<br>
Go back to the main passage and turn right to go into the red
tunnel.<br>
After the door shuts climb to the passage above and go to the end
and jump<br>
to the ledge on the right. Grab the Uzi ammo and enter the
passage. Kill<br>
the alien that suddenly appears then get more Uzi ammo and
continue on to<br>
the ramp that leads up to the veg-o-matic.<br>
<br>
Run up the ramp and stop just before it. A boulder begins to roll
towards<br>
you so jump left then continue when all is safe. Use the Save Gem
at the<br>
top then push the block on your left 2 times and go down the
tunnel on the<br>
right to find 2 switches. Use the right switch and jump back
quickly to <br>
avoid the trap door. Do a safety drop through the trap door then
move<br>
forward to start another boulder rolling then jump back and over
the hole.<br>
Move forward again and go up the tunnel and climb the ledge on
the left to<br>
reach the switch. Use it then, then make your way back to the 2
switches<br>
and go through the now open door. Kill the alien in the passage
and use<br>
the switch in the corner to open a door. Get some Uzi ammo in two
of the<br>
corners.<br>
<br>
Enter the door and save your game then slide into the next room.
Kill the<br>
2 monsters at the bottom but DO NOT attack the next creature that
appears.<br>
IT IS YOU! Anything you do - it does.<br>
<br>
Climb the ledge to the right and jump to the stone pillar then
leap to the<br>
ledge by the door and use the switch to open the trap door. Turn
and jump<br>
to the sandy ledge then climb and jump to the sandy pillar and
finally<br>
leap to the sandy ledge. Go to the middle of the ledge quickly
and your<br>
double will fall into the pit. If the door shuts you were too
slow and you<br>
have to try again.<br>
<br>
Go back to the rocky ledge with the pit and get some Uzi ammo
then go up.<br>
Kill the Centaur and load up on more Uzi ammo and kill another
alien. Go<br>
right at the end of the tunnel to find a switch that opens a
door. Run <br>
along the left ledge and use the next switch. You are on a TIME
LIMIT so<br>
ignore the clips and run back to the entrance and across the
bridge.<br>
<br>
Grab the Uzi clips lying here then approach the alien device and
USE it to<br>
EXIT this level and start a cool movie.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Great Pyramid - Items: 30 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 3<br>
<br>
This is it!! The FINAL LEVEL!! And it starts with the hardest
enemy in<br>
this game - one big ALIEN! After a couple hundred rounds of Uzi
fire or<br>
20-30 well placed shotgun blasts he will die. There are several
strategies<br>
for killing this guy - I'll let you find yours. Just DON'T FALL
IN THE PIT<br>
or you may as well load that last save game.<br>
<br>
Find and pick-up all 6 Uzi clips from the corners of the room
below then<br>
enter and slide down the red tunnel. Push the block 3 times then
go up the<br>
ramp and push the next block once then climb to the tunnel above.
Save the<br>
game then dash through the veg-o-matic and don't fall through the
fake<br>
floor. Go right at the intersection until you reach a block which
you push<br>
forward. Return to the intersection and turn right going past the
door and<br>
drop into a room with a block. Pull the block then climb up to
the tunnel<br>
and go left and back down and push the block forward then go back
to the <br>
red door. <br>
<br>
Get on the block and use the switch then turn and enter the next
room and<br>
go right and jump to the ledge on the slope. Jump to the next
ledge and<br>
a third jump to the long ledge that cross the entire slope. A
bridge <br>
appears behind your so jump back and cross the bridge to find
SECRET #1 -<br>
medkit, shells, and magnum clips. Use the switch 2 times - down
then back<br>
up to secure a portion of the bridge then return to the ledges
and go left<br>
to the tunnel entrance.<br>
<br>
Proceed up the tunnel and reverse when the boulder comes at you.
Avoid the<br>
boulder then go back up the tunnel to repeat this with a second
boulder.<br>
At the end of the tunnel is a collapsible ledge which you need to
roll onto<br>
then run off before you fall. Hang and drop down taking severe
damage then<br>
recharge your health and use the Save Gem around the corner.<br>
<br>
Shoot the Scion until it explodes starting a major earthquake for
the rest<br>
of the game. Go through the door and kill the 3 monsters in the
room then<br>
drop down to the rocks below on the right of the bridge. Do a
safety drop<br>
through the hole by the wall then turn and leap and grab the
crevice. <br>
Shimmy to the right ignoring the darts which only do minimal
damage. At <br>
the far right drop and slide backwards toward the lava but jump
backwards<br>
before you fall in.<br>
<br>
Enter the next room and go to the right side of the hill and
continue down<br>
to trigger a boulder. It will roll by and fall into the crack.
Now go to<br>
the swinging blade and do a timed jump across to some spikes that
you need<br>
to WALK through. The next bridge is made of collapsible panels so
you need<br>
to cross it in a double jump with the first jump putting you in
the center<br>
of the bridge and the second in the doorway.<br>
<br>
On the left wall is a crevice you can jump to. Grab on and shimmy
right<br>
until you can drop to the ledge and get SECRET #2 - medkits and
Uzi clips.<br>
Jump backwards off this ledge to the slanted pillar then jump
forward to<br>
the pillar with the Save Gem. Jump into the tunnel on the right
and run<br>
through it as the floor falls away behind you. Time your jump
through the<br>
cleaver then go right down the slope and try to outrun the
boulder chasing<br>
you. When the chase is over you can jump over the boulder to get
a medkit<br>
then jump back and turn right to slide down a second slope. Time
your jump<br>
past the blade to get to the ledge then drop to the tunnel and
run past the<br>
lava that enters the tunnel.<br>
<br>
Get the medkit and continue past more lava then use the switch
and enter <br>
the door. Get the Uzi clips in the passage to your right then go
back to<br>
the lava hole. A boulder rolls above you so when it passes jump
over the<br>
hole and hang as a second boulder rolls by overhead. Climb up and
enter <br>
the next room with a series of ledges with flames on them. Stay
close to <br>
the wall and make the jumps. You will take some heat damage but
not nearly<br>
as much as if you catch on fire. If you do burst into flames drop
down <br>
to the water below to put out the fire then swim back to the
beginning and<br>
try again.<br>
<br>
You should now be in a room with a pool and a cleaver. Jump to
the panel<br>
in front of the blade which falls out from under you so pull
yourself up<br>
and leap into the cave entrance through the swing blade to find
SECRET #3 -<br>
Uzi ammo and a medkit. When you are ready to leave to to the edge
of the<br>
entrance - take one step back then jump to that tiny pool below.
Grab the<br>
Uzi clips then swim through the tunnel and into the next room.
Save your<br>
game then get some more Uzi ammo and proceed to the large room.<br>
<br>
Natla is back and is flying around shooting fireballs at you!
Blast her <br>
with Uzi fire and dodge as much as you can. Heal yourself often.
After<br>
shoot her down she will get up and you must continue to blast her
until<br>
she STAYS down. Enter the tunnel and get some Uzi ammo. Note:
Natla was<br>
the last enemy in this game so any more ammo is strictly for
obtaining a<br>
PERFECT ITEM score.<br>
<br>
Head up the ramp in the corner and jump into the passage that
leads to<br>
some pillars. Jump to the nearest then turn and jump to the
pillar on the<br>
left. Jump to the pillar below the door then climb up to the top.
Turn <br>
and drop through the hole landing on the pillar then turn and
jump across<br>
the next 2 pillars. Jump to the pillar below the door and grab on
and <br>
climb into the tunnel. Run down the hall and do a safety drop
from the <br>
hole onto another pillar.<br>
<br>
Turn right and leap to the ledge below the tunnel then climb into
the <br>
tunnel and run forward. Slide down the long slope to EXIT the
level and<br>
the game. <br>
<br>
CONGRATULATIONS!!! You just finished TOMB RAIDER!<br>
<br>
Enjoy the closing movie and don't forget...<br>
You can now go back and replay any level with all weapons and
infinite<br>
ammo. Mr. T-Rex falls much quicker under UZI FIRE!!! Have Fun!!<br>
